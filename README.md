The cloud is changing the way applications are designed. Instead of monoliths, applications are decomposed into smaller, decentralized services. These services communicate through APIs or by using asynchronous messaging or eventing. Applications scale horizontally, adding new instances, as demand requires.

These trends bring new challenges. Application state is distributed. Operations are done in parallel and asynchronously. The system as a whole must be resilient when failures occur. Deployments must be automated and predictable. Monitoring and telemetry are critical for gaining insight into the system. The Azure Application Architecture Guide is designed to help you navigate these changes.

Above paragraphs are taken from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/, and if you navigate through all the sections If find everything that you are looking for. I also gave it a shot of directly reading those without basic knowledge of Azure services and had a very hard time to frame a picture in my mind while reading those. The biggest challenge was from where to start and how to get comfortable with Azure Architecture Center.

Here I am trying to attempt to Use various Azure Service to shape it into traditional Enterprise Architecture. The whole objective of this exercise is to learn following Azure Service and design a high-level enterprise solution.
